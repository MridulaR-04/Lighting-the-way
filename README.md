# Lighting the Way: Gesture-Controlled LED System using Arduino

## Abstract:
This IoT project presents a novel approach to controlling LED lights using hand gestures, facilitated by Python, Arduino, and OpenCV. The system utilizes a combination of hardware components including an Arduino UNO board, LED bulbs, breadboard, jumper wires, and resistors. The software stack comprises Python for high-level control, Arduino IDE for micro-controller programming, and OpenCV coupled with Mediapipe for gesture recognition.

The primary objective of this project is to enable intuitive control of LED lights based on hand gestures, providing a hands-free and interactive user experience. By recognizing the number of fingers open on a hand using computer vision techniques provided by OpenCV and Mediapipe, the system dynamically adjusts the number of illuminated LED lights on the Arduino board. For instance, opening all five fingers triggers the activation of all five LED lights, while progressively fewer fingers lead to a corresponding reduction in the number of illuminated LEDs.

## Key Functionality:

1.	Real-time hand gesture recognition: The system accurately detects the number of open fingers on a hand using OpenCV and Mediapipe, enabling seamless interaction.
2.	LED control through Arduino: The Arduino board is programmed to respond to the hand gesture data received from Python, activating or deactivating the corresponding LED lights accordingly.
3.	Dynamic adjustment: The number of illuminated LEDs dynamically changes based on the number of fingers detected, offering flexibility and adaptability in controlling the lighting setup.

## Objectives:

1.	Implement a real-time gesture recognition system using OpenCV and Mediapipe.
2.	 Establish seamless communication between Python and Arduino for LED control.
3.	Develop a scalable solution capable of accommodating multiple LED lights.
4.	Ensure robustness and accuracy in gesture detection for reliable operation.

## Potential Applications:

1.	Home Automation: Enable intuitive control of lighting systems based on hand gestures, enhancing convenience and accessibility.
2.	Educational Tool: Serve as an engaging platform for teaching basic principles of computer vision, micro-controller programming, and hardware integration.
3.	Accessibility Enhancement: Cater to individuals with physical disabilities by providing an alternative method for interacting with electronic devices.
4.	Interactive Displays: Integrate gesture-controlled LED systems into exhibitions, presentations, or art installations to captivate audiences and encourage interaction.

Overall, this project demonstrates an innovative approach to LED control, combining computer vision techniques with micro-controller programming to create an interactive and intuitive system with diverse practical applications.
